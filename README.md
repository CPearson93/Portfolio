# Portfolio
This is my personal web site to introduce myself and my work.
This will be an on going solo development environment for me to have fun implementing features.
I am going to be providing links or showing snapshots of projects I've worked on to display my skills.
I will aim to make the site look good in general, but also in all display formats.
There will be experiments to make the site interactive and have little easter eggs.
I will also have a couple of little minigames to play with. An example is Tic Tac Toe.
(The site will respond with moves of it's own, but the moves will be generated by random number not AI.)


master branch is what will be running on the live site. Any tested and approved changes will be pushed here when ready to go live.

develop branch is for final testing of changes before they get pushed to live.
